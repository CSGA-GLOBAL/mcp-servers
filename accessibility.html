 <h2>1. Our Commitment to Accessibility</h2>
 <p>CSGA Global is committed to ensuring digital accessibility for all visitors with disabilities. We aim to provide a website that is compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standards. This Accessibility Statement describes our accessibility initiatives and how users can request assistance.</p>
 <h2>2. Accessibility Features</h2>
 <h3>2.1 Keyboard Navigation</h3>
 <p>Our website is designed to be fully navigable using keyboard controls alone. All interactive elements can be accessed using the Tab key, Enter key, and other standard keyboard navigation methods. Skip-to-content links are available to bypass repetitive navigation elements.</p>
 <h3>2.2 Screen Reader Support</h3>
 <p>We utilize semantic HTML and ARIA labels to ensure compatibility with screen readers including NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver. Images include descriptive alternative text (alt text) to convey meaning to users relying on assistive technology.</p>
 <h3>2.3 Color Contrast and Visual Design</h3>
 <p>Our website meets WCAG AA standards for color contrast ratios, ensuring text is readable for users with low vision or color blindness. We avoid relying solely on color to convey information, using supplementary visual indicators where necessary.</p>
 <h3>2.4 Responsive and Flexible Design</h3>
 <p>The website is designed to be responsive and flexible, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes and orientations. Users can adjust text size and zoom levels without breaking the layout or losing functionality.</p>
 <h3>2.5 Captions and Transcripts</h3>
 <p>Where video content is provided, we include captions for all spoken dialogue and sound effects. Audio content is accompanied by transcripts whenever possible.</p>
 <h2>3. Known Limitations</h2>
 <p>While we strive for full accessibility, some third-party content and external links may not meet our accessibility standards. We are working with our partners to improve accessibility across our ecosystem.</p>
 <p>Some PDF documents on our website may have varying levels of accessibility. We are committed to converting important documents to accessible formats upon request.</p>
 <h2>4. Accessibility Standards and Conformance</h2>
 <p>We aim to conform to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards. Our accessibility efforts include:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Regular accessibility audits and testing</li>
 <li>Training for our development team on accessible design practices</li>
 <li>Continuous improvement of accessibility features</li>
 <li>Compliance with relevant accessibility laws and regulations</li>
 </ul>

 <p>We use clear, sans-serif fonts and appropriate line spacing to support readers with dyslexia. We recommend users with dyslexia consider using specialized reading software in conjunction with our website.</p>
 <h3>6.2 Motor Accessibility</h3>
