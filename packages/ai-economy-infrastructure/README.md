## Architecture Principles

### 1. **Non-Replacing Orchestration**
This MCP does NOT replace the 10 specialist servers. Instead, it:
- Knows which specialist to call for which queries
- Aggregates results when multiple specialists are needed
- Provides unified interfaces over specialist capabilities

### 2. **Intelligent Routing**
Router uses:
- Natural language query analysis
- Keyword-based specialist matching
- Sector and context-aware selection
- Graph-based cross-ecosystem mapping

### 3. **Data Integration Hub**
Acts as central nervous system:
- Collects data from all 10 specialists
- Aggregates into ecosystem dashboards
- Feeds OneOS MOOC with enrollment/progress data
- Maintains cross-ecosystem data schemas

### 4. **Single Point of Contact**
For organizations:
- One unified interface for entire ecosystem
- One certification pathway coordinator
- One incident response coordinator
- Unified billing and contracts
