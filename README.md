## What Our 80 MCPs Do

Each MCP server exposes tools that AI assistants can call directly. When you install a CSGA MCP into Claude Desktop or Cursor, your AI gains specialised capabilities — running compliance audits, scanning for vulnerabilities, analysing sector-specific data, or managing cloud infrastructure — all through natural language conversation.
